# CPP_04
### Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

## Exercise 00:
### Polymorphism

Start by implementing a simple base class called Animal. It has one protected
attribute

## Exercise 01:
### I don’t want to set the world on fire
Constructors and destructors of each class must display specific messages.

## Exercise 02:
### Abstract class
Creating Animal objects doesn’t make sense after all. It’s true, they make no sound!

## Exercise 03:
### Interface & recap
Interfaces don’t exist in C++98 (not even in C++20). However, pure abstract classes
are commonly called interfaces.
Thus, in this last exercise, let’s try to implement interfaces in order to make sure you got this module
